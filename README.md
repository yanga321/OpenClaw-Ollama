# 🚀 Installation & Setup with Ollama
Follow these steps in order to get your local environment running.

1. Install and Start Ollama
Open Termux and run the following command to install the Ollama package:

``` 
pkg install ollama
```
Start the Ollama server:
```
ollama serve
```
Note: Keep this session running. You will need to open a new Termux session for the following steps.

2. Download the Model
In a new Termux session, pull the desired model. For example:
```
ollama pull glm-5:cloud
```
Run model 
```
ollama run glm-5:cloud
```

3. Install OpenClaw
Install the OpenClaw CLI globally using npm:

```
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```
🛠️ Configuration
Run the onboarding wizard to configure your environment and install the background daemon:
```
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```
⚡ Usage

ollama launch openclaw --config
```

💡 Troubleshooting
Memory Issues: Running LLMs on mobile can be resource-intensive. Ensure you have at least 4GB of free RAM.

Stay Awake: Use the termux-wake-lock command to prevent Android from killing the process when the screen is off.

## ✅ Testing
You can validate that the README still includes the required setup instructions by running:

```
make test
```

This runs a small smoke test script (`tests_readme.sh`) used by CI.
